# This file is used to configure the automation rules.
# Each automation rule must have
# - name 
# - trigger                       define the type of trigger (webhook based, time based, ...)
# - topic / event                 if webhook based
# - at                            if time based
# - timezone                      if time based. optional. Using UTC if not provided
# - conditions                    list of conditions to match to trigger the action
# - actions                       list of actions to execute 

# TRIGGERS
# Triggers are configuring the event triggering the automation. They can currently be webhook based or time based
#
# TRIGGERS EXAMPLE
#
# - name: switch_mgmt_vlan  
#   trigger: webhook
#   topic: "device-events"        mandatory - Exemples are avaibled below
#   event: "SW_ASSIGNED"          optional  - Exemples are avaibled below
#
# - name: time_trigger
#   trigger: time
#   at: "08:00"
#   timestamp: 1669317522

# CONDITIONS (optional)
# Conditions can be used inside a rule to prevent its execution if all the conditions are not met.
# Different types of conditions are available (see README.md for more details), but each of them must
# have a "type", which will define the required parameters. 
# For example, to only execute the rule based on fields of the webhook event:
#
# CONDITION EXAMPLE
#
# conditions:
# - type: numeric                 event.rssi must be between -75 (included) and -45 (included)
#   field: event.rssi
#   above: -75                    optional if below is set
#   below: -45                    optional if above is set
# - type: partial_match           event.device_mac must contain 5c5b35
#   field: event.device_mac
#   value: 5c5b35
# - type: exact_match             event.device_mac must be 5c5b35001122
#   field: event.device_mac
#   value: 5c5b35001122
# - type: multiple_matches        event.device_name must be one of AP-Building-A-01 and AP-Building-A-03
#   field: event.device_name
#   value:
#   - AP-Building-A-01
#   - AP-Building-A-03
# - type: time                    current time must be between 08:00 CET and 18:00 CET, and week day monday or friday
#   after: "08:00"                optional
#   before: "18:00"               optional
#   timezone: Europe/Paris        optional. If not defined, using UTC
#   weekday:                      optional
#     - mon
#     - fri

# ACTIONS
# All the actions configured in the rule are processed by the script for each matching rule. For more information 
# about the rules configuration, please check the README file.
# The action may contain variables. The variable values must be present in the received webhook event.
#
# ACTIONS EXAMPLE
